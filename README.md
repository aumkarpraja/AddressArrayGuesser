# ArrayAddressGuesser
A mini program of sorts that I made in C for CPS305: Data Structures and Algorithms.

- User is given a pointer (address) of some random item in the 2-D array. 

- User must guess the corresponding INDEX of the array (i and j values).

- This guessing game repeats for various addresses in the array, until the user quits.
